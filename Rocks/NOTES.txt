Random irregular rock objects, prepared via displacement mapping
in Blender, then decimated and atlased.  

All the chips share an atlas, to avoid texture swaps. 

The prefabs come in with a RigidBody so the chips/lumps act as 
independent objects.  The collider is a mesh by default, 
so if you want them to interact with the ground you'll need to turn
off the mesh collider and turn on the (much worse fitting)
sphere / box colliders.
